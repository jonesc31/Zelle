# *Zelle*
# What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors? 

Zelle is a peer-to-peer(P2P) company that speeds up electronic payments bewteen 2 people securely. It is considered a safe and secure way to send money because it does not require any sensitive financial information and they also do not hold funds. They are literally a middle-man to transfer funds from one bank to another. Their competitors include CashApp, Venmo, Paypal, etc. 


# How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?
Zello uses techonolgy to their advantage by allowing all transactions on their platform to be done online to and from people you know and trust. The best part is, funds are typically available in a few minutes and with no additional fee for consumers. This is much more faster and convenient way to transfer funds rather than using the traditional way, which can usually take up to 3 business days. 

Zelle is considered a FinTech company because it uses technology in finance to create a convenient and safe way to electronically transfer funds that can be available within minutes. 

# Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?
Zelle is an exemplary company within the FinTech space because it is convenient; you no longer have to leave your home to make a transfer to a friend or family member, it is safe; you have to have a phone number or email address to able to transfer funds, and it is timely; you can send and recieve funds within minutes, and last but not least, the service is free. 

Nothing in life is perfect and Zelle is no exception. Some of their weaknesses include, the inability to cancel a payment once its sent, the inability to transfer funds from a credit card, and the inability to recoup your funds if you were a victim of fraud. 


# What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?
Although Zelle does have some important weaknesses, I don't believe they're set in stone. As time goes on, I believe they will find a work around to fix these weaknesses and also adapt to technology to make their app more convenient for users. All in all, I see longevity for Zelle in the future.
